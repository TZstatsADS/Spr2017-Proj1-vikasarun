# Project 1: Analyzing Presidential Inauguration Speeches

### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2017

+ Projec title: Are Donald Trump's speeches really different from those of his predecesors?
+ This project is conducted by Vikas Arun

+ Project summary: Using sentiment analysis and topic generation, I compare Mr. Trump's speeches to those of his predecessors, intepreting where he doesn't appear to differ and where he does, and how that contradicts common statements and opinions espoused by the media. The full project can be found in the doc folder.
