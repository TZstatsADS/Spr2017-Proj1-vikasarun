# Project 1: Analyzing Presidential Inauguration Speeches

### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2017

+ Project title: Are Donald Trump's speeches really different from those of his predecesors?
+ This project is conducted by Vikas Arun

+ Project Methodology: Using sentiment analysis and topic generation, I compare Mr. Trump's speeches to those of his predecessors, intepreting where he doesn't appear to differ and where he does, and how that contradicts common statements and opinions espoused by the media. The full project can be found in the doc folder.

+ Project Findings: What we find is that Donald Trump's inauguration speech is one of the most positive inauguration speeches ever given, contrary to the speculation reported in lots of media articles. In addition, after splitting the speeches into 15 topics, we found that in most of the cases, the amount of time Trump spent on a particularly topic was not unusual. There were two topics for which Donald seems to have spent significantly more time that most other Presidents. These topics are patriotism/destiny and unity. We conclude that much of the strong feeling surrounding Trump, whether positive or negative, comes from a response to these topics being the driving factor of the new administration.
