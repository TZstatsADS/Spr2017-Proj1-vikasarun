# Project: 
### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files. It also has a saved image of an R workspace that has run the code. This is so that one can see what this
type of workspace would look like without running the code and waiting for 20 min for the LDA to run.

Once you set your working directory to this folder, the R notebook code should run easily.
